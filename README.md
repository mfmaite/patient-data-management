# Getting Started

Welcome! 👋🏻
This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Here’s a quick guide on how to run it for the first time.

### Running the Project for the First Time

After cloning the repository, navigate to the root directory and run the command `npm install`.
This will install all the necessary dependencies.
Once everything is properly installed, run `npm start`.
Now, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
You should see the project up and running! 🥳

### Running the Project (After Initial Setup)

If it’s not the first time you’re running the project (i.e., you already have the dependencies installed), simply run `npm start` and open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.

## Libraries and Utilities

For the development of this project, I used several libraries to simplify the process:

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) – An extension of the CSS language. In this project, I used it to implement CSS modules to avoid class name collisions.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) – A CSS framework packed with utility classes.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) – A tool for quickly finding and resolving issues in the code.
- [React Toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify) – For implementing in-app notifications.
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) – To easily implement animations.
